        Creating a table. Its elements

        The main element for creating a table in HTML is the <table> element. The table can contain the following elements:
        
        <caption> -  Used to provide a title or description for the table. 
        This element is placed immediately after the opening <table> tag, and its content is displayed above the table.

        <thead> -  Used to group the column headers of the table. 
        This element is placed inside the <table> element, and its content consists of one or more rows represented by <tr> elements.

        <tbody> - Used to group the main content of the table. 
        This element is placed inside the <table> element, and its content consists of one or more rows represented by <tr> elements.

        <tfoot> - Used to group the table footer or additional information. 
        This element is placed inside the <table> element, and its content consists of one or more rows represented by <tr> elements.

        <tr> - Used to represent table rows. This element is placed inside <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, or <table>, and its content consists of one or more <td> or <th> elements.

        <td> - Used to represent data cells in the table. This element is placed inside <tr>, and its content represents the value of the data cell.

                    The "colspan" attribute is used in HTML table cells (<td> or <th>) to specify the number of columns that a cell should span horizontally. 
                    It allows a cell to extend across multiple columns.

                    There is also a "rowspan" attribute that you can use yourself.
