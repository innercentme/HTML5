    Tags <b>, <i>, <tt>, <s> are used to highlight text and give it a specific stylized appearance on a web page. 
    However, these tags have no semantic meaning and are used mainly for decorative purposes.

    <b> - This tag is used to highlight text and give it a bold style. It does not add any additional semantic meaning to the text, but only makes it look bolder.

    <i> - This tag is used to emphasize text and make it italic. It also has no special semantic meaning, but only changes the appearance of the text.

    <tt> - This tag is used to highlight text and give it a style similar to typewritten text.
    However, in modern browsers, its styling can vary. It also has no semantic meaning and is used mainly for decorative purposes.

    <s> - his tag is used to highlight text and create a strikethrough effect. 
    It indicates that the text has been deleted or is no longer relevant. Like the previous tags, it has no semantic meaning and is only used for visual effect.
    -->

    <b>Bold text</b>
    <br>
    <i>Italic text</i>

    <!--
    The <strong> and <em> tags are used to give semantic meaning to text and to make it stand out visually on a web page.

    <strong> - This tag is used to highlight text and give it semantic power or weight. 
    It conveys the importance or weight of the text, which can be useful to search engines and people viewing the page. 
    Usually, text surrounded by the tag <strong> appears in bold, but the appearance may depend on the styling of the page.
    
    <em> - This tag is used to highlight text and give it a semantic meaning that indicates emotional emphasis, emphasis, or importance. 
    It conveys the tone and expressiveness of the text. 
    Typically, text surrounded by an <em> tag appears in italics, but again, the appearance may depend on the page styling.

        
    The use of <strong> and <em> tags is recommended instead of <b> and <i> because they carry semantic meaning that helps search engines and tools understand
    the importance and emotional emphasis of the text, as well as promotes accessibility and better understanding of the content by users.

    The <small> and <big> tags are used to logically highlight less important or smaller text (<small>) and important or larger text (<big>) on a web page. 
    However, the use of these tags in modern web standards (HTML5) is not recommended as they have lost their semantic meaning and do not have a standard style definition.

    Instead of these tags, it is recommended to use more semantic and structural tags, such as headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) or to style the text with CSS.

    <big> -  This tag is used to highlight important or larger text on the page.

    <small> - This tag is used to highlight less important or smaller text on the page. 
    -->
    <big>Important</big>
    <br>

    Two more types of text formatting in HTML:
    
    <del> - This tag is used to strike through text.

    <ins> - This tag is used to underline text.
    
    The <del> and <ins> tags have no semantic content in HTML. They are used mainly for visual formatting of text, not for conveying semantic meaning.

    In HTML, the <sub> and <sup> tags are used to display text as an upper and lower index.

    Setting the date and time on the website

    The <time> tag is used to indicate the date or time on a web page. It can have a "datetime" attribute that specifies the exact date or time in ISO 8601 format.
    
    Interesting fact: The <time> tag can also include additional elements such as <date>, <time>, <day>, <month>, <year> to specify a date or time in more detail.
