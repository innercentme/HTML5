    <!-- 
            This code represents an HTML form that contains various elements for entering and selecting data. 
            The basic structure of the form includes the use of <fieldset>, <legend>, <label>, <input>, <textarea>, <select>, <optgroup> and <option> elements. 
            Let's analyze each element separately:

        1. <form action="halder.php" name="Form" autocomplete="on">: 
            This tag defines the beginning of the form and sets the form attributes such as "action" (specifies the URL to process the form data),
            "name" (name forms) and "autocomplete" (indicates whether autocomplete for form fields should be enabled).

        2. <fieldset>: 
            This tag defines a group of related form elements. In this case, three <fieldset> elements are used to divide the form into three sections: 
            "Login Form", "Personal Message" and "Personal Data".

        3. <legend>: 
            This tag defines a caption for each group of elements in the <fieldset>. 
            The headings "Login Form", "Personal Message" and "Personal Data" indicate the content of each group of elements.

        4. <label>: 
            This tag defines a label (textual description) for an input or selection field. 
            Used for a linked element to provide a link between a label and a form element. 
            The "for" attribute is usually used to specify the ID of the associated element.

        5. <input>: 
            This tag is used to create input fields. The specified code uses two input fields of type "text" and "password". 
            For the first field, the "id" attribute is used to indicate the field identifier, as well as the "required" attribute, which indicates that the field is mandatory.
        
        6. <textarea>: 
            This tag is used to create a text input field with multiple lines. 
            In this case, the "name", "id", "cols" (number of columns) and "rows" (number of rows) attributes are set,
            as well as the "required" attribute to indicate mandatory filling.

        7. <select>: 
            This tag is used to create a select list. There are two <select> elements in the code. 
            The first one contains several <option> elements that represent choices. The second contains two <optgroup> groups, 
            each of which contains its own <option> elements. Additionally, the first <select> element has an "id" attribute, 
            and the second has a "multiple" attribute, which allows you to select multiple options at once.

        8. <input type="submit" value="send">: 
            This tag is used to create a form submit button. 
            The set type "submit" means that the button sends the form data to the server. 
            The value of the "value" attribute specifies the text that will be displayed on the button.
