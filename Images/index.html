<!--  Read before start

The <img> element is used to simply insert an image without additional semantics. 
You specify the path to the image using the src attribute and alt text can be added using the alt attribute. 
However, the <img> element itself does not provide additional information about the image or its context.

The <picture> element, which contains <source> tags, allows you to set different image options depending on the conditions. 
Each <source> element has a srcset attribute that specifies the path to the image, and a media attribute that specifies the condition for using that image. 
Using <picture> you can make images responsive based on window sizes or other parameters.

The <figure> element is used to group an image together with its caption or description. You can use it to create blocks of images with their description or caption. 
  Users will be able to more easily perceive the connection between the image and its description, since they are in the same block.

    <!--
      The code <img src="istockphoto-1086610854-612x612.jpg" alt="The man who looking on moon"> represents the <img> element used to insert an image on a web page. 
      The "src" attribute specifies the path to the image file "istockphoto-1086610854-612x612.jpg". 
      The "alt" attribute defines the alternative text that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or if the user is using a web reader.

        The <picture> code is used to select and display the optimal image depending on the characteristics of the device and the size of the viewport. 
        Let's take a look at its components:

        1. <picture>: 
        This is a container element that contains image options to choose from. Inside it are the <source> elements and the <img> element.

        2. <source>: 
        This is the element that defines the image variant to select. 
        In the code, we have three <source> elements, each of which has a srcset attribute that specifies the path to the image, and a media attribute
        that sets the media query to select the image. The first <source> has the media request (min-width: 1200px) and the image path, the second has (min-width: 768px)
        and the corresponding path, and the third has (min-width: 300px) and the corresponding path.

        3. <img>: 
        This is an element that sets the initial image that is used if none of the <source> elements are suitable for the device or the media request is not satisfied.

        The <figure> code is used to group an image together with its caption or description. 
        Let's take a look at each component:

        1. <figure>: 
        This is a container element that contains an image and its caption or description. In this case, we have an image and a corresponding caption wrapped in a <figure>.
        
        2. <figcaption>: 
        This is an element used to define a caption or description for an image. 
        In our case, we have a <figcaption> element that contains a <p> element with the caption or description text of the image.
