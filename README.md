Comprehensive HTML Course
I have created a comprehensive HTML course that serves as a solid starting point for those interested in learning web development. While the course doesn't cover every single HTML tag and attribute, it provides a strong foundation in the basics of HTML.

The course is carefully structured and covers essential topics such as:

Structure of an HTML document
Formatting text
Creating links
Working with images
Understanding forms
By focusing on these core aspects, students can gain a good understanding of how to create simple web pages.

Throughout the course, students will be introduced to various HTML tags and their usage, along with relevant attributes to enhance the functionality and appearance of their web pages. They will also learn about the importance of proper document structure, semantic HTML, and web accessibility best practices.

Note: It's important to note that HTML is a vast language with many advanced features. While this course may not cover all the intricacies, it provides a solid starting point for beginners, equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills to begin their web development journey.
